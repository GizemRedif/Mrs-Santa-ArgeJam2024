# 🎅 Mrs. Santa 

**Mrs. Santa** is a fun 2D platform game that we developed in just 24 hours with my team of 4 as part of ArgeJam. In the game, Mr. Santa tries to overcome various obstacles to deliver the New Year's gifts on time. But he must deliver the gifts on time and collect the materials his wife wants. He must also reach Mrs. Santa before midnight.
